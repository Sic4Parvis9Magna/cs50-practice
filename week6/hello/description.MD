# Hello
Implement a program that prints out a simple greeting to the user, per the below.
```
$ python hello.py
What is your name?
David
hello, David
```
## Specification
Write, in a file called `hello.py` in `~/pset6/hello`, a program that prompts a user for their name, and then prints `hello`, `so-and-so`, where `so-and-so` is their provided name, exactly as you did in Problem Set 1, except that your program this time should be written (a) in Python and (b) in CS50 IDE.

## Usage
Your program should behave per the example below.
```
$ python hello.py
What is your name?
Emma
hello, Emma
```
## Testing
While `check50` is available for this problem, you’re encouraged to instead test your code on your own for each of the following.

* Run your program as `python hello.py`, and wait for a prompt for input. Type in `Emma` and press enter. Your program should output `hello, Emma`.
* Run your program as `python hello.py`, and wait for a prompt for input. Type in `Rodrigo` and press enter. Your program should output `hello, Rodrigo`.
